The "pkgmatch" package package finds packages, as well as individual functions,
which best match a given input. Inputs can be text descriptions, sections of
code, or even entire R packages. "pkgmatch" finds the most closely matching
packages using a combination of Language Models (LMs, or equivalently, "LLMs"
for large language models), and traditional [token-frequency
algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25).
