The "pkgmatch" package package finds packages, as well as individual functions,
which best match a given input. Inputs can be text descriptions, sections of
code, or even entire R packages. "pkgmatch" finds the most closely matching
packages using a combination of Language Models (LMs, or equivalently, "LLMs"
for large language models), and traditional [token-frequency
algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25). This document describes
how the "pkgmatch" package works.

## Summary

- Input chunking:
    - Packages as either text or code
    - Text chunks:
        - Entire package text, including README, vignettes, and all function documentation entries
        - Package text without function documentation entries
    - Code chunks: None; entire package code as sole input chunk
- LM sizes: Input = 8,096 tokens, embedding length = 768
- Similarity algorithms:
    - Cosine similarities from LM embeddings
    - BM25 values
- Final ranking:
    - "Reciprocal Rank Fusion" algorithm of Cormack, Clarke, & Büttcher (2009).
- Reproducibility: Entirely deterministic and reproducible

## Input chunking

The LMs used here accept input lengths or contexts of up to 8,096 tokens.
That is long enough to accommodate the entire code base of very large R
packages, and no chunking is implemented for code inputs. It is possible that
this may lead to truncation of code inputs for very large packages, but that
should generally be very unlikely.

Text input of packages includes text from the package description (in the
"DESCRIPTION" file), followed by the "README" file (where present), text of all
vignettes, and text of all function descriptions, and parameters of each
function. All code is removed from these text sources, including removal of all
code chunks in `.Rmd` documents.

A reduced version of the input text is also submitted both to LM and
token-frequency algorithms, through removing the text of function descriptions,
leaving only package description, README and vignette text. Text inputs and
outputs are thus considered in two forms: the full form, generally appended
with `_with_fns`, and the reduced form appended with `_wo_fns`.


## Inputs as text or code

All functions accept an `input` parameter, with an accompanying `input_is_code`
logical flag. This flag is important because text inputs are passed to [a
different model](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en) than
[code inputs](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code). If
not specifically set, the value of `input_is_code` flag is determined by first
passing the `input` to an internal function, `text_is_code()`. That function
defines inputs as code if the number of recognisable words in the input is
equal to or greater than a default threshold of 98%. The [code file in which
that function is
defined](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgmatch/blob/main/R/utils.R)
contains a short script at the bottom which was used to define this threshold.
This automated distinction between text and code inputs can always be
over-ridden by specifying a value for the `input_is_code` parameter.

## Similarities between inputs and corpora of R packages

The algorithms described here were applied to all R packages from [rOpenSci's
suite](https://ropensci.org/packages), as well as from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). Most functions accept a "corpus" parameter,
with values of either "ropensci" or "cran" to compare inputs to these specified
corpora. The following sections describe algorithms this package uses to assess
similarities between inputs and all packages within these corpora.

### LM similarities

"pkgmatch" access LMs through a local [ollama server](https://ollama.com), as
described in a [separate
vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgmatch/articles/ollama.html).
LMs are exclusively used here to generate "embeddings", which are numeric
vectors of a fixed length representing a (reduced) version of the
representation of the underlying text data within the multi-dimensional tensor
space of the model. In short, and to avoid any need to actually understand that
sentence: embeddings convert a text input into a numeric vector, and enable
different texts to be numerically compared.

The comparisons are implemented here, as in the majority of LMs, as cosine
similarities. Cosine similarities effectively quantify the similarity in the
multi-dimensional space of the LM. These similarities are generally preferred
in LMs, because similarities in *orientation* of two (or more) embedding
vectors are generally more informative than similarities in magnitude.

For a given input and corpus, the output of this LM component specifies a
cosine similarities for each package, along with a corresponding rank, where
the first-ranked package is the most similar.

### Token-frequency similarities

Similarities from LMs alone are often not reliable, and better results are
often generated through combining LM results with equivalent outputs from
alternative algorithms. The "pkgmatch" package also passes all input to an
internal version of the ["Best Match 25" (BM25)
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25), an algorithm that is
commonly used in conjunction with LM outputs. Like LM cosine similarities,
the BM25 algorithm generates vectors of numeric values quantifying the
similarity between a given input and all packages (or functions) within the
specified corpus.

Importantly, the version developed here separates the two steps required in the
algorithm, of calculating inverse document frequencies (IDFs) of all terms in
the specified corpora, and then using those IDFs to calculate final scores for
input documents. The package is distributed along with pre-calculated values of
IDFs for all terms (both text and code) for both corpora. These are
automatically downloaded the first time any functions are called, and from that
time on, always available for immediate use in all subsequent calculations.

#### Tokens for text input

For text input, the BM25 algorithm requires inputs to be converted to "tokens",
for which this package relies on [rOpenSci's tokenizer
package](https://docs.ropensci.org/tokenizers). The BM25 values then assess
similarities through adding similarities for all tokens shared between two
documents, weighted by the inverse of token frequencies across all packages
within the specified corpus. This inverse weighting ensures that similarities
are more influenced by similar usage of infrequent tokens, and less by usage of
common tokens.

#### Tokens for code input

For code input, tokens for BM25 input are taken as the names of all functions
called, pre-pended with namespaces, such as `base::print()`. Function call are
identified from the "treesitter" algorithm, using functionality of the
["treesitter" R package](https://davisvaughan.github.io/r-tree-sitter/). This
package is currently restricted to [the R language
only](https://github.com/r-lib/tree-sitter-r), and thus code input in this
package considers code from `/R` sub-directories only, and excludes any source
code in other languages.

All function calls in all packages within each corpus are first converted to
IDFs. Calculation of BM25 values are weighted by these so that, as for
word-token frequencies, resultant similarities are most strongly affected by
similarities in usage of less common functions, and relatively unaffected by
similarities in usage of common functions.

## Combining similarities with "rank fusion"

Finally, the best matching outputs from the various combinations of input
chunks and algorithms are combined using the [*Reciprocal Rank Fusion* (RRF)
algorithm
of Cormack, Clarke, & Büttcher
(2009)](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf). Scores for
each combination of input chunk and algorithm are converted to ranks, and all
ranks submitted to the RRF algorithm. A default value of `k = 60` is used at
all times, as recommended by the original paper, which also suggests very low
sensitivity of results to variations in this value. Where inputs are entire
packages, final rankings are generated separately for code and text.
